\section{Introduction}
These are my personal notes as I study complex analysis. The book I use is Stein \& Shakarchi's Complex Analysis, the second book of their Princeton Lectures in Analysis book series. I try to present these notes in a lecture note format so I may look back on them throughout my studies and my solutions (right or not) to selected exercises will follow each chapter.
