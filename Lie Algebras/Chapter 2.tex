\section{Lie Groups and Algebras}
\subsection{Notes}

Now we discuss the main objects of interest: Lie algebras. But first we build up to it by first considering the more basic Lie groups.

\begin{definition}[Lie Groups]
	A Lie group is a group in which the elements are labeled by continuous parameters and the group operation is smooth. 
\end{definition}

A Lie group is special because it is also a smooth manifold, we are particularly interested in compact Lie groups in which the formed topological space is compact.
