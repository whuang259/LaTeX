\section{Introduction}
These are my personal notes as I work through Georgi's ``Lie Algebras in Particle Physics." I was assigned this book to skim through at the beginning of my first quantum field theory class to read before we started quantum chromodynamics. Unfortunately, I did not and got rapidly lost in the representation theory. This document is my attempt to fix my past mistakes. The aim is to have some brief notes for each chapter followed by my solutions (right or not) to each exercise.
