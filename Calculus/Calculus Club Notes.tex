\section{Introduction}
I wrote these notes for the students of Alex Zamora's ``Calculus Club," a pilot initiative to introduce AP Calculus AB concepts to middle schoolers/rising high schoolers. The general layout of the material follows that of Strang and Herman's free online calculus textbook\footnote{Available \href{https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1}{here}}, though adjusted slightly to suit my taste. Originally these were intended to serve as my lecture notes for sessions that I teach, but they quickly evolved into a mix of study notes, a quick reference, and an alternate textbook.
